                            <p>As an independent contractor, I work with clients to design and develop sites that will help
                                them expand their market reach from the real world onto the Internet. My preferred technologies
                                right now include PHP and Javascript, though a lot of our clients have been more WordPress
                                oriented. I'm also working on picking up Angular and Laravel in my spare time, as both have
                                really interesting features.

                            <p>The overpayments team's purpose was to make repayment arrangements (most often to correct payroll
                                errors) with employees of one of NGA's clients, a huge international company I'm not at liberty
                                to name due to a non-disclosure agreement. Basically we provided phone and email support
                                to these employees through the repayment process, drafted notices and invoices, and also
                                supported the client's HR Managers via phone and email, all with reference to our Oracle
                                CRM system.</p>

                            <p>This was actually a work placement from my Paralegal program that turned into an amazing summer
                                job while I filled in for someone on maternity leave. In general the job was twofold; on
                                one hand we handled telephone &amp; email support, and drafted notices and memoranda for
                                applicants and appellants making Freedom of Information requests, and on the other hand we
                                provided clerical support to the mediators and adjudicators of the Tribunal Services Division.
                                This usually entailed drafting and editing documents, as well as filing, faxing, and mailing.</p>

                            <h6>September 2016-June 2018</h6>
                            <p>To be honest, this is a pretty great program. I was expecting a heavier focus on a lot of the
                                basic stuff I already knew; as I've been building sites since I was 12 or 13, my original
                                idea in taking this program was more about getting a diploma to show that I know my stuff,
                                I don't think I expected to learn quite as much as I did. Aside from providing a great foundation
                                in OOP, the greatest strength of this program is bridging the gap between front-end and back-end
                                development. A part of me feels like a third year with focus on more advanced frameworks
                                and other tools (like AWS, Selenium, Angular etc..) would be great, but the program definitely
                                gave me the skills to pick up new technologies easily on my own.</p>

                            <h6>Memorial University of Newfoundland - St. John's, NL</h6>
                            <h6>September 2014-April 2016</h6>
                            <p>After moving back to Newfoundland from Toronto, I decided to head back to MUN and finish the
                                degree I'd started way back in 2002. I changed my major from Philosophy to English, and knocked
                                it out the new degree requirements in 2 years. It was a good experience all in all, really
                                polished up my communication skills, and helped develop my writing, on top of expanding my
                                research skills.
                                <br />
                                <br /> Also I received a written commendation from the English Department for achieving an A in
                                their Advanced Creative Writing: Poetry course, which I'm reasonably proud of. I've had poems
                                published on two separate occasions.</p>

                            <h6>September 2010-April 2012</h6>
                            <p>Though I later decided that a career in law wasn't a good fit for me, this program was really
                                valuable. Doing legal research and analyzing statutes, cases, and decisions requires a considerable
                                amount of precision and a very critical eye. In a lot of ways programming and law are fairly
                                comparable; writing a good contract requires the same broadly-scoped logic as constructing
                                a program. In a court of law, as in a compiler, it's not the spirit of the document that
                                matters: the specific words make a huge difference, and can make or break a good contract.
                                I strongly believe the analytical skills I picked up in this program have had a dramatic
                                impact on my programming skills.
                                <br />

                            <h6>September 2002-April 2006</h6>
                            <p>This was the degree program I started after high school, which I completed as the English degree
                                above. I had some financial issues in 2006 that made it impossible to finish at the time,
                                but in general my studies in Philosophy (which were actually split between MUN's Grenfell
                                Campus in Corner Brook and the main campus in St. John's) really helped instill a sense of
                                rigor and precision which has benefitted me as a programmer. Similarly to how I described
                                my Paralegal program above, this program (with its intense dissection of linear logic) really
                                helped develop the kind of thinking and mindset required for great programming.
                                <br />
                                <br /> As well, while I was studying I organized and conducted peer-tutorials on some of our more
                                advanced Philosophy courses.</p>

                    <p class="white-text">I built this little site using
                        <a class="white-text" href="https://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a> and
                        <a class="white-text" href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> which are pretty cool tools. My IDE was
                        <a class="white-text" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, and I published it from the terminal using
                        <a class="white-text" href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> to this
                        <a class="white-text" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github User Page</a>, which is an awesome service.</p>
